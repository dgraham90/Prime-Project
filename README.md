##What I'm pleased with
*	I like the UI, its clean and looks modern.
*	The unit tests I created in js/Tests.js helped ensuring the prime algorithm was returning valid data
*	Adding caching to the prime number array helps with keeping the calculation times down when running the webapp

##What I would do if I had more time
*	The browser struggles to render the table when the amount of columns get larger, I would work on optimizing this to provide a better user experience.
